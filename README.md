SMS Spam Detection:


**This project is a machine learning-based SMS Spam Detection system built using Python. It classifies incoming text messages as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing techniques. The model is trained on a labeled SMS dataset and uses CountVectorizer as well as TfidfVectorizer for text feature extraction and Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification. It's a simple yet effective project to demonstrate how ML can be applied to real-world text classification problems.**
